# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression

EGULARIZATION
There is the case that when you predict the model, performance in the training set is good but the model performs on the test set very badly, maybe it is because of overfitting. To avoid overfitting to improve the performance on test set to help with the regularization, you use the Ridge or Lasso Regression to do that.Â¶
Another case that you need to do regularization is that when you have so many features while there is not so many data points in your dataset. In this case, Linear Regression will fail to come up with the model. So Ridge or Lasso Regression will be applied.
To know exactly when you have to choose Ridge or Lasso, lets do some comparision between two models and then we can understand when we you them.
